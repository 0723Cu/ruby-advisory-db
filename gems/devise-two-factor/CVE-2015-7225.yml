  TOTP Replay Attack in devise-two-factor 1.1.0 and earlier.
date: 2015-09-17
description: |
  OTP replay vulnerability in devise-two-factor 1.1.0 and earlier allows local
  attackers to shoulder-surf a user's TOTP verification code and use it to
  login after the user has authenticated. This vulnerability has been assigned
  the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7225.

  By not "burning" a previously used TOTP, devise-two-factor allows a narrow
  window of oppertunity (the timestep period) where an attacker can re-use the
  value, given they already know the user's username and password.

patched_versions:
  - ">= 2.0.0"
