  gollum-grit_adapter Gem for Ruby Search Functionality Arbitrary Command
  Execution
date: 2014-12-04
description: |
  gollum-grit_adapter Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the program
  failing to properly sanitize input in search. Grit uses command line calls to
  git grep to implement search functionality. git grep takes a -O or
  --open-files-in-pages option that will pipe the results of grep to an
  arbitrary process, permitting command execution.

  Note that the grep result must find the string 'master' (or 
  whatever is the default branch that gollum uses) in any of the wiki's
  documents for this to succeed.
