title: uglifier incorrectly handles non-boolean comparisons during minification
date: 2015-07-21
description: |
  It was discovered that the upstream library for uglifier Gem for Ruby,
  UglifyJS, versions 2.4.23 and earlier, was affected by a vulnerability which
  allows a specially crafted JavaScript file to have altered functionality after
  minification. This bug was demonstrated to allow potentially malicious code
  to be hidden within secure code, activated by minification.
