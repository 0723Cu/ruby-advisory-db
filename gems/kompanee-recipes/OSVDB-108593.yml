title: Ruby kompanee-recipes Gem allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands
date: 2014-06-30
description: |
  kompanee-recipes Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in /lib/kompanee-recipes/heroku.rb
  that is triggered when handling shell metacharacters passed via the 'password',
  'user', 'deploy_name', and 'application' variables. This may allow a remote
  attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
