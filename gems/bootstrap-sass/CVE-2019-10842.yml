date: 2019-04-04

description: >-
  bootstrap-sass is a Sass-powered version of Bootstrap 3, ready to drop right
  into your Sass powered applications. Affected versions of this package are
  malicious. The file `lib/active-controller/middleware.rb` contains a backdoor
  which will enable a remote attacker to run arbitrary code on the server by
  decoding a specific cookie value and evaluating its content.

unaffected_versions:
  - "<= 3.2.0.2"
patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.2.0.4"
