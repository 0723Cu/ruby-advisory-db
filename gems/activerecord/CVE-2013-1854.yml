title: Symbol DoS vulnerability in Active Record

description: | 
  When a hash is provided as the find value for a query, the keys of
  the hash may be converted to symbols. Carefully crafted requests can
  coerce `params[:name]` to return a hash, and the keys to that hash
  may be converted to symbols. Ruby symbols are not garbage collected,
  so an attacker can initiate a denial of service attack by creating a
  large number of symbols.
