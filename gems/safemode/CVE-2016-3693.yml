title: Information leakage through templates

description: |
  A provisioning template containing `inspect` will expose sensitive
  information about the Rails controller and application when using
  Safemode rendering (the default setting). This includes the
  application secret token, possibly permitting a privilege escalation
  when the app is using signed cookies.
