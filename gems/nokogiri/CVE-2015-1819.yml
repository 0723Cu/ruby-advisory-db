title: Nokogiri gem contains several vulnerabilities in libxml2 and libxslt
date: 2015-04-14
description: |
  Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the libxml2 and libxslt libraries
  that the Nokogiri gem depends on.

  CVE-2015-1819
  A denial of service flaw was found in the way libxml2 parsed XML
  documents. This flaw could cause an application that uses libxml2 to use an
  excessive amount of memory.

  CVE-2015-7941
  libxml2 does not properly stop parsing invalid input, which allows
  context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read
  and libxml2 crash) via crafted specially XML data.

  CVE-2015-7942
  The xmlParseConditionalSections function in parser.c in libxml2
  does not properly skip intermediary entities when it stops parsing invalid
  input, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
  (out-of-bounds read and crash) via crafted XML data.

  CVE-2015-7995
  The xsltStylePreCompute function in preproc.c in libxslt 1.1.28 does not
  check whether the parent node is an element, which allows attackers to cause
  a denial of service using a specially crafted XML document.

  CVE-2015-8035
  The xz_decomp function in xzlib.c in libxml2 2.9.1 does not
  properly detect compression errors, which allows context-dependent attackers
  to cause a denial of service (process hang) via crafted XML data.
